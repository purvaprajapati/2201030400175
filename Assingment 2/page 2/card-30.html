    *Garden Art Therapy:*
    <br/>
    
    <br/>
    1. Creating art installations using natural materials found in the garden, such as leaves, flowers, and branches.
    <br/>
    2. Painting or sketching landscapes or individual plants in the garden.
    <br/>
    3. Sculpting with clay or other malleable materials inspired by elements of nature.
    <br/>
    4. Journaling or reflective writing while sitting in the garden, focusing on sensory experiences and emotions evoked by the surroundings.
    <br/>
    5. Participating in group activities like collaborative mural painting or creating a communal garden sculpture.
    <br/>
    
    <br/>
    *Dancing Therapy:*
    <br/>
    
    <br/>
    1. Freeform dance sessions where participants move to music without choreography, focusing on self-expression and emotional release.
    <br/>
    2. Guided movement exercises led by a therapist or instructor, incorporating elements of various dance styles like ballet, contemporary, or jazz.
    <br/>
    3. Partner or group dance activities to promote social interaction, cooperation, and trust.
    <br/>
    4. Choreographed routines designed to enhance physical fitness, coordination, and body awareness.
    <br/>
    5. Dance improvisation exercises where participants respond spontaneously to prompts or music cues, encouraging creativity and spontaneity.
    <br/>
    
    <br/>
     Here&#39;s a list of activities commonly found in fitness classes:
    <br/>
    
    <br/>
    1. Cardiovascular exercises (e.g., jogging, jumping jacks, high knees) to improve heart health and endurance.
    <br/>
    2. Strength training exercises using bodyweight, resistance bands, or weights to build muscle strength and tone.
    <br/>
    3. Flexibility exercises (e.g., stretching, yoga poses) to improve range of motion and prevent injuries.
    <br/>
    4. Core-strengthening exercises (e.g., planks, crunches, Russian twists) to stabilize the spine and improve posture.
    <br/>
    5. Interval training (e.g., HIIT - High-Intensity Interval Training) combining bursts of high-intensity exercise with periods of rest or lower intensity to boost metabolism and burn calories.
    <br/>
    6. Balance and stability exercises (e.g., single-leg stands, balance board exercises) to improve coordination and reduce the risk of falls.
    <br/>
    7. Functional movements (e.g., squats, lunges, push-ups) that mimic everyday activities to improve overall fitness and mobility.
    <br/>
    8. Group fitness activities (e.g., dance classes, aerobics, kickboxing) to make workouts more engaging and enjoyable while providing social support.
    <br/>
    9. Cool-down and stretching routines to lower heart rate, reduce muscle tension, and promote relaxation after the workout.
    <br/>
    10. Mind-body activities (e.g., Pilates, Tai Chi, mindfulness meditation) that focus on connecting physical movement with mental awareness and relaxation.
